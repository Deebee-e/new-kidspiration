Hey everyone; Welcome to kidspiration!!

KidSpiration is a project borne out of my love for kids and a desire to see children grow up to be motivated Adults filled with kindness. This was built as my final Portfolio project on my ALX Software engineering Journey.
It is a nextJs project created with 'create-next App'.


     Technologies used;
  NextJs
  Github(Version Control System
  
Various Dependencies and Libraries installed included (but inexhaustive);
    NodeJs, flowbite,@fontsource/geist-mono",
    @mdi/js
    @mdi/react"
    flowbite-react
    Formik, react-dom,
    yup amongst others.

Data-Base and Auth:
KidSpiration is mainly a dynamic frontend app. I utilized a local JSON file as a lightweight database to store and manage user data. This approach allowed for rapid prototyping and simplified the development process by eliminating the need for a separate backend server or a more complex database system.

For authentication, I implemented a basic local authentication mechanism. User credentials (username and password) are stored within the JSON file.

This project was deployed to Vercel.

Please note: 
Vercel requires a direct access to the project repository before deloyment, however I created a parent folder before creating the project folder (kidspiration).
To fix this, I created a new-kidspiration folder and imported the same codes. This can be seen on https://github.com/Deebee-e/new-kidspiration.git 

I am open to collaborations and technical advice. 
Thank you for reading this far friends..
