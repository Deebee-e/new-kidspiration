Hey everyone; Welcome to new - kidspiration!!

KidSpiration is a project borne out of my love for kids and a desire to see children grow up to be motivated Adults filled with kindness. This was built as my final Portfolio project on my ALX Software engineering Journey. It is my desire that as I improve on the quality and features in the future, parents; especially African parents would put in more efort into commendation than punishent as seen in African cultures.
It is a nextJs project created with 'create-next App'.

Please note: 
Vercel requires a direct access to the project repository before deloyment, however I created a parent folder before creating the project folder (kidspiration).
To fix this, I created this new repository new-kidspiration folder and imported the same codes. This can be seen on https://github.com/Deebee-e/new-kidspiration.git
